## About Me
I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Statistical Artificial Intellgent & Learning Lab (TSAIL)](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) of Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor  [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). From 2017 to 2021, I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of California, Berkeley, with triple majors in mathematics, computer science, and data science.

My research interests encompass statistical machine learning, the theoretical aspects of deep learning, and their practical applications. Specifically, I am currently focused on generative adversarial models.
